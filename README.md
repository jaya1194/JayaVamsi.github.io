<h1>The GDELT Project</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

[<h2>The GDELT Project</h2>](https://www.gdeltproject.org) <br/>
The dataset that interests me a lot is "The GDELT project dataset.In this dataset they used Event Database ,Global Knowledge Graph- it consists two parallel data streams, one is used to encoding the entire knowledge graph with all of its fields,
and the other encoding only the subset of the graph that records "counts" of a set of predefined categories llike number of protestors, number killed, sickened.
In Linguistics unigram, bigram , ngrams are available for dozzen stations back a decade at 30 minute resolution and update daily.   
The GDELT(Global Database of Events,Languages andTone) Project vision is to track all the riot,violent,protest attakcs news accross the world in around 65 language.
The GDELT project is created by Kalev Leetaru of Yahoo!.The Project main motto os to connect the people accross the world into single massive network that captures what happening around the world and what its context is and who;s involved and the world is feeling about it.
GDELT includes data from 1979 to present and it captures all the voilation behaviour accross the world.
For example :- In recent times itself there is a huge outbreak of covid-19 and we came to known the news of each and every country and connecting to the the rest of the world from one place.
Apart from this we can also be more updated towards the society and get awareness of what happening around the world. 
This Project helps every individual track the data with huge insights like monetoring the data and analysing the graph which helps people to understand and track the news easily.
The projet uses so many visualising techniques and packages for plotting the graph and to track the previous data which used to merge all the connecting news.This covers covers the topics in Densio

# Text Book

<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
[<h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>](http://alex.smola.org/drafts/thebook.pdf) <br/>
<h2>Alex Smola , S.V.N. Vishwanathan</h2>
THe book I am interested is "Intoduction to Machine Learning" written by Alex Somla and S.V.N. Vishwanathan.
Alex Smola is Senior Principal Researcher and Machine Learning program Leader at National Information Communications Technology(ICT) Australia.
S.V.N. Vishwanathan is a professor of Computer Science at University of California, Santa Cruz.
In my Undergrad I have done so many projects related to machine learning that makes me more interesting to advance a level in Machine learning.
This Introduction to Machine Learning intermediate book helps me to advance my level from beginner to intermediate which is helpful to me.
As this book covers so many advance topic algorithms like Density Estimation,Graphical models,Conditional densities ,Linear models etc.
